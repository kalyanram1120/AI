This repository contains Python implementations of the **Minimax** and **Alpha-Beta Pruning** algorithms. These algorithms are used for decision-making in two-player games like chess, tic-tac-toe, etc.

## Algorithms

- **Minimax Algorithm**: A recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in a game. It minimizes the possible loss in a worst-case scenario while trying to maximize the opponent's loss.
  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimization over Minimax that reduces the number of nodes evaluated by skipping branches that cannot influence the final decision.
